            <h3>Join or create a game</h3>
            To play a game you can either create a new one or join an existing game. <br/>

            <h3>How the game works</h3>
            At the beginning a <b>&#x1f4a3;</b> is randomly distributed to one of the players.<br/>
            While possessing the <b>&#x1f4a3;</b> it loses life points. By tapping on the <b>&#x1f4a3;</b> it can be further made angry. 
            <br/>
            This is also the way for you to gain points and outreach your enemies.
            <p/>
            <b>But beware!</b> The initial amount of life points is unknown. <br/>
            If unsure, better pass the <b>&#x1f4a3;</b> to one of your enemies. Drag and Hold to move it around. <b>Better be quick</b>, because as long as you have the &#x1f4a3;, you 'll never know how hot it is.
            <p/>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h3>End of Round</h3>
            When the <b>&#x1f4a3;</b> eplodes winners gain extra points and one poor soul loses them all.
            After one player reaches above 100 points. He is the ultimate winner of the game.
