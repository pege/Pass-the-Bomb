            <h4>How the game works</h4>
            At the beginning a <b>bomb</b> is randomly distributed to one of the players.<br/>
            While possessing the <b>bomb</b> it loses life points. By tapping on the <b>bomb</b> it can be further made angry.
            <p/>
            <b>But beware!</b> The initial amount of life points is unknown. <br/>
            Better pass the <b>bomb</b> to one of your enemies. Drag and Hold to move it around. Better be quick, because as long as you have the bomb, you 'll never know how hot it is.
            <p/>

            <h4>End of Round</h4>
            When the <b>bomb</b> eplodes winners gain extra points and one poor soul loses them all.
            After one player reaches above 100 points. He is the ultimate winner of the game.
