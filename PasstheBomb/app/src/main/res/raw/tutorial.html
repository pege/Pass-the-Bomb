            <h4>How the game works</h4>
            At the beginning a <b>bomb</b> is randomly distributed to one of the players.<br/>
            While possessing the <b>bomb</b> it loses life points. By tapping on the <b>bomb</b> it can be further made angry. <p/>
            <b>But beware!</b> The initial amount of life points is unknown. <br/>
            Better pass the <b>bomb</b> to one of your enemies.
